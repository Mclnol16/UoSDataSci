# Introduction to Data Science
## This is a github repository for course content for MATH 384 Introduction to Data Science.

**Instructor:** [Jason M. Graham](https://sites.google.com/site/jasonmgrahamus/)

**Contact:** Email: jason.graham@scranton.edu

This course will run during the Fall 2018 semester at the [University of Scranton](http://www.scranton.edu/). Content will be added to the
repository as the course proceeds. For students enrolled in the course, addtional
material such as the official class syllabus, readings, etc. will be posted
on the learning management system (D2L) for the course.

To obtain the files from this repository, you can either clone the repo or download the files directly. To download, simply click the **Clone or download** button and then select **Download zip**. To clone the repo you must have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed; information on this can be found below. With git installed, use the command (in your terminal or command window)

`git clone https://github.com/jmgraham30/UoSDataSci.git`

To update the repository, use the command

`git pull origin master`

Alternatively, you can use the [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app for accompishing either of these tasks.

For this course, we will use the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language. R can be downloaded for free [here](https://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/). In addition, we will use the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) integrated development environment (IDE) which can be downloaded [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). It is also possible to run R and Rstudio virtually through the cloud through RStudio-cloud. This can be accomplished by going [here](https://rstudio.cloud/). One very nice feature of RStudio-cloud is that it has a number of tutorials to help learn to use R listed under the primers tab.

## Class Resources

### R for Data Science and Other Books
A valuable reference for the course is the text *R for Data Science* by Grolemund and Wickham. An online version of this text can be found [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

In addition to *R for Data Science*, the books [*Data Science Design Manual*](http://www.data-manual.com/) and [*Modern Data Science with R*](https://mdsr-book.github.io/index.html) are also very valuable resources.

### Git and Github
It is recommended that you use the [git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system for tracking your code. If you do not already have git installed on your computer (MAC probably already installed, Windows probably not installed), it can be install from [here](https://git-scm.com/). The github desktop app makes working with git very convenient; this can be installed [here](https://desktop.github.com/). To use github you must register for an account at the [website](httPs://github.com/). To learn more of the details on version control with git and github, see this [article](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159/) or the [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). A very nice introduction to version control with git and github that explains how these tools are integrated with RStudio can be found [here](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html).

It is also recommended that you have a reliable text editor installed. Atom is a good example and can be installed [here](https://atom.io/).

## Additional Resources
In addition to R, you may want to have access to some of the Python data science tools. The best way to obtain these is through an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) installation, which can be achieved by a download found  [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
