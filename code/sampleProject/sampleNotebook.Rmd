# Sample Notebook

## Section 1

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now the tidyverse suite of packages should be loaded and their various functions ready for use.

## Section 2

Let's import some data.
```{r}
df <- read_csv("Data/sampleData.csv")
```

We can see the first five rows of the data frame.
```{r}
head(df,5)
```

Let's make a plot using our data frame. We will create a bar plot the total number per each color. 
```{r}
ggplot(data=df,mapping = aes(x=color,y=total.number)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
```

## Some common notebook commands

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
