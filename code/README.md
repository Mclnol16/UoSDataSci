# Code for Introduction to Data Science.

For this class we will primarily use R. This folder is where code for the course will be maintained. In addition to base R, we will make use of a number of R packages. In particular, most of the code will assume that the user has the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) suite of packages installed. This can be acheived via the command `install.packages("tidyverse")`, or using the install packages function in RStudio.
