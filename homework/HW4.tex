  \begin{enumerate}
    \item   Go through section 9 Functions of the R Programming course in the {\tt swirl} package, then answer the following questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item   What is a function? 
      \item What does the {\tt Sys.Data()} function do? How many input arguments are required?
      \item What are the two ``slogans'' for R stated by John Chambers? 
      \item How do you see the source code for an R function? 
      \item Why would having default arguments by useful?
      \item What does the {\tt args} function do? Give an example of its use. 
      \item Explain why one might want to pass a function as an argument to another function. 
      \item What is an easy way to return the last element of an arbitrary vector? 
      \item What does the {\tt paste} function do? 
      \item What is the significance of the ``dot-dot-dot'' argument for a function in R? 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Write an R function that inputs a vector and computes the mean of the vector. Save your function in an R script called {\tt my\_mean\_func.R}. Be sure to test your function and make sure it is working correctly.
    \item Write an R function that inputs two whole numbers and returns the remainder after dividing the first by the second. Save your function in an R script called {\tt my\_remain\_func.R}. Be sure to test your function and make sure it is working correctly.
    \item Read the first three sections of Chapter 4 Scores and Rankings from \emph{The Data Science Design Manual} (remember that this is available through the library) and answer the following questions.
     \begin{enumerate}
      \item  What is a ``scoring function?''
      \item What is a ``score'' according to the definition given in section 4.2?
      \item Describe an approach or approaches to building effective scoring systems and evaluating a scoring system. 
      \item What is a ranking? Provide some examples. 
      \item What are the characteristics of a good scoring function? 
      \item Describe $Z$-scores and normalization.       
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Find or make up a formula for some kind of score. Write an R function that implements your formula. Apply your function to some data that is either real or simulated.  Discuss whether your scoring function is good or not.  
  \end{enumerate}
